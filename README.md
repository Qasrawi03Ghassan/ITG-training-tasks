### 🔔 Task requirements
- Implementing a centered login form that has two textfields and a login button with simple styling, and adding the required functionality and alerts for use cases.
  - If the user tries to login without entering a username or a password, an alert message will appear above the login button telling the user to fill all the fields.
  - If the user enters wrong credentials, an alert with the message "Invalid credentails" will appear above the login button.
  - If the user enters correct credentials, show "Login successful" message. (Correct username is "admin" and password is "12345")

### 💡 Added functionalities  
- Red exclamation marks will appear behind each label when trying to login and it's field is empty.
- Password show and hide button.
- Entering correct credentials will redirect the user after 2 seconds to the home page.
- External links to sign in using Github, Gmail, or Outlook accounts.
- Responsiveness.
